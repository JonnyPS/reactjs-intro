JSX elements can have event listeners, just like html elements.

Example:
<img onClick={myFunc} />

Conventions for naming event listeners follow these two rules:
 - the first word is usually 'on' - example: 'onClick' / 'onMouseOver' etc.
 - camel case is used.

A list of valid event names can be found here:
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events

An event listener attribute's value should be a function.
The above example would only work if 'myFunc' was a valid function.

Example:

function myFunc(e) {
	alert('hello world');
}

<img onClick={myFunc} />
