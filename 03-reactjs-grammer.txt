Grammer in JSX elements is mostly the same as html elements, but there are a few differences to be aware of.

Class:
writing this in html is correct:
<h1 class=header">I am a header</h1>;

In react this will not work.
'Class' is a reserved word in javascipt, and as our JSC gets translated in to javascript, this will cause conflicts.
Instead, 'class' is written as 'className' in JSX.

Example:
<h1 className="header">I am a header</h1>;

Self Closing Tags:
Omitting self closing tags in html is usually fine.
For example in html, '<br />' and '<br>' will both work.
However, in react, only '<br />' will work.
Omitting the self closing tag will throw up an error.
The sam applies for the '<img>' and '<input>' tags.
