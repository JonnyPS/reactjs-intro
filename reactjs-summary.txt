React Creates a virtual dom, it mirrors what's in the physical DOM, but only updates what changes.
This makes it quick and light.

JSX:
JSX is a syntax extension. 
It means you can insert regular HTML tags into Javascript files.
A basic unit of JSX is called a 'JSX Element'.
JSX elements are treated as javascript expressions. This means they can go anywhere a javascript expression can go.

Example: 
var header = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

The variable header would render as an h1 tag in the browser.

JSX elements can also have attributes, example:
var header = <h1 class="article-header">Hello World</h1>;

JSX elements can also be nested:

var myDiv = (
	<div>
		<a href="https://www.google.com"><h1 class="article-header">Hello World</h1></a>;
	</div>
);

JSX elements must have one outermost element, (like in the example above).
The below example will not work:
var paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);

Files containing JSX code must be compiled before the browser can read them. The compiler will convert any JSX code into regular Javascript.
