An alternative way to use conditional statements in JSX is to use the ternary operator.
It is more compact, and can be injected directly within the JSX element.

Ternary Operator Example:

x ? y : z

If 'x' equates to true, then 'y' will be returned by the operator.
If 'x' equates to false, then 'z' will be returned by the operator.

In our example from the previous lesson, where we used a conditional statement to determine the value of the variable 'i':

i >= 10 ? alert('i is equal or greater than 10!') : alert('i is less than 10!')

Using this in a JSX element would look like the following:

var headline = <h1>{ i >= 10 ? alert('i is equal or greater than 10!') : alert('i is less than 10!') }</h1>;
