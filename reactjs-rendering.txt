JSX elements must be rendered to appear in a web page

Taking our example from the JSX Elements intro page, we will render the element on the screen so that it displays as html.

JSX Element:
var header = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

Rendering the element:
// require the react library, which gives us access to react methods 
var React = require('react');

// require the react-dom library, which gives us access to react DOM methods
ReactDOM =require('react-dom');

// the first element renders the above variable as html, the second argument tells us where in the DOM to render the element
ReactDOM.render(header, document.getElementById('app'));

Rendering JSX elements doesn't need to be done with variables, html can be directly inserted.
The below example would output exactly the same as the above:

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));
