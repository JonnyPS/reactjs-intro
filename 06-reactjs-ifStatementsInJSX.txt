You cannot inject an if statement into a JSX expression.

This Example would not compile:

<h1>{if (i = > 10) {alert{'i = ' + i} }</h1>


A common method of expressing conditionals in JSX is to use a conditional statement to return the value of a variable, this variable can then be rendered.

Example:

if (i >= 10) {
	var message = <h1>i is equal or greater than 10!</h1>;
} else {
	var message = <h1>i is less than 10!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(message, document.getElementById('app'));

The conditional statement is run, the value of the variable 'message' is set, and then we call the react method to render the element.
