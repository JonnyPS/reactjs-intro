So far we've been writing regular html within javascript, known as JSX elements.
In this part we go further and write regular javascript within the html within the javascript.
This will change the way elements get rendered.

Example:
ReactDOM.render(
	<h1>2 + 3</h1>,
	document.getElementById('app')
)

What will get rendered in the browser?
Answer: 2 + 3

However, if we were to render the html content housed within curly braces, it would render as a regular javascript expression would.

Example:
ReactDOM.render(
	<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>,
	document.getElementById('app')
)

What will get rendered in the browser?
Answer: 5

Example 2:
ReactDOM.render(
	<h1>{ Math.PI.toFixed(3) }</h1>,
	document.getElementById('app')
)

What will get rendered in the browser?
Answer: 3.142

The curly braces themselves won't be translated as javascript, they are purely markers to signal when javascript starts and ends,
similar to how quotations marks signal the beginning and end of a text string.
