Keys are attributes.
Keys do not do anything that you can see.
They are used for React to 'remember' from one render to the next, what order things were in etc.
This can be helpful for changing lists such as to-do-lists, or a shuffled list such as changing search results.

Using previous Example:

var strings = ['first', 'second', 'third'];

// iterate over the array, pass a parameter 'string' which will act as a placeholder for each array item
// This time pass a parameter 'i'
var listItems = strings.map(function(string, i){
	return <li key={ "li-"+i }>{ string }</li>;
});

Output:
<ul>
  <li key="li-1">first</li>
  <li key="li-2">second</li>
  <li key="li-3">third</li>
</ul>
